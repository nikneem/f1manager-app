# Wearing down
Engines and chassis wear down. The amount of wear and tear depends on the amount of races you have driven with that component, the per race wear down percentage, and the maximum wear down percentage. These values are all listed when buying a chassis or engine. Since drivers do not wear down, these values are not shown in the list of drivers.

## Wear down percentage
The wear down percentage is the amount of wear your component receives during a race. So when no race has been driven, the component is considered to be brand new and thus can be sold as new.

When buying an engine or chassis, the system will list the wear down percentage, and the maximum wear down percentage. The amount of wear down can never exceed the maximum. 

## An example
Let's say you buy an engine with a wear down percentage of 1.05%, and a maximum of 8.30%. Buy the time you bought this engine, it's value was $ 43 Mln.

You're happy with the engine so you decide to keep it for 6 races. The engine performed very good and gained a little bit in value. If you want to by the engine now, it would cost you 47.9 Mln. meaning that the current value of the engine is 47.9 Mln.

When selling the engine, you should calculate 6 times 1.05% (6 races have been driven with this engine, and the wear down percentage is 1.05%) leaves us with 6.30%. This 6.30% does not exceed the maximum of 8.30% so 6.30% is the correct percentage to calulate with. This means when you sell the engine, it will be sold for $ 44,882,300.00. Congratulations, you just earned a little over $ 1.8 Mln.
