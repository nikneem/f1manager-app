# Money

Of course, we're not playing with real money here. All money spent is fake so nothing to worry about. Once you've created your team, an amount of $ 120,000,000.00 will be available. You can spend this money to buy drivers, an engine and a chassis.

## Earn money

There are two ways of earning money. The easiest way is to but team components that end up performing good in Formula 1 races. The other one is to take advantage of the race team components gain (or lose!!) value depending on their race performance.

### By race results

The amount of points your team gains, is in direct relation to the amount of money your team will earn. After the race results are calculated, your team will receive 5 percent (5%) of the gained points, multiplied by $ 1,000,000.00. Let's say for example, that your team gained 64 points.

```
64 * 5% = 3.2
3.2 * $ 1,000,000.00 = 3.2 Mln.
```

Meaning 5 percent of 64 points is 3.2. Multiplied by a million makes that your team earns 3.2 Million dollars.

### By trading

Team components (driver, engine or chassis) have a certain value. At the beginning of the season, this value is determined by their performance over the previous season. This value is the price you need to pay to buy the component, but also the price you get when selling an item.

Depending on their race performance, components can gain or lose value. So when you buy a fairly cheap component that appears to do well in races it gains value. When you now sell the item, you gained money.

> Beware! Both your engine and chassis, wear down. This means that once you bought an engine or chassis and a race has been driven, the engine and chassis will lose value because of wearing off. This means that when you sell this engine or chassis, you will not receive the full value back but a percentage. This percentage depends on the amount of wear down (how many races did you use the engine or chassis).
