# Teams

Once you are logged in, you are considered to be a `player`. Each `player` can have only one team per `season`. 

## Seasons
A `season` is name is bound to the year the `season` takes place. Usually the Formula 1 seasons starts somewhere around march and ends (depending on the amount of races driven during that season) somewhere late November of that same year.

## Your team
When a new `season` starts, you are asked to create a new team. Come up with a good name, although you can always change your team name. Once you have created a new team, you can start buying team components.
Your team requires two drivers, an engine and a chassis.

> If your team does not consist of two drivers, an engine and a chassis, your team is considered to be incomplete and will not receive points or money.

## Team locks
Teams are locked the moment the qualification for a certain race starts. From then on, you can not sell or buy team components. If your team is incomplete by that time, your team will not receive any points or money for that specific race.

## Predictions
You can still set your race predictions. Prior to each race you're allowed to predict the race winner and the race strategy of the winner.
Doing so gives you to opportunity to gain even more points. The predictions can be saved up until the very moment the race starts. Because the winning race strategy is very dependent on the race conditions (Hot, Cold, Rainy) it is wise to make this prediction as late as possible, but not too late obviously.

## Wearing down
Unlike drivers, engines and chassis wear down. This means that when you buy a certain engine (or chassis) it's losing value each race. The value lost is different per engine and chassis and is visisble when you but the engine. There is also a maximum wear down. At that point, the engine or chassis will not lose value anymore.

## Earn money
Team components will change value depending on their performance in actual Formula 1 races. So one way to earn money is when a driver is fairly cheap and starts performing very well in actual races. The driver will gain value and once sold, you earned money.

> It is a lot harder to earn money with engines and chassis because although the engine or chassis will gain value, the one you bought is subject to wearing down.

## Winning
The goal of the game is to gain as many points as possible. To you better spend all your money on that single item delevering more points.
