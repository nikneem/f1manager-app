# Points calculations

Once a race has been driven our moderators will update the race results to our server, starting the points calculations process. At first, the race results are always provisional. On your team dashboard, you will see the provisional results and also see the potential amount of points, and money your team will gain when these results become final. Once all (if applicable) investigations are done and the result is checked by our moderators, the result becomes final and the calculated points and money are awarded to your team. For the points gained for qualification and race results, it is important to understand that we will always maintain the official qualification and race result as published on the FIA website.

## Predictions

Prior to every race, you can do a winner and strategy prediction. Select the driver you think is going to win the race. Also, you can make a strategy prediction. You can select up to 10 sets of tires teams can use during a race. You gain points with predicting the winner correct, the amount of pitstops (penalties excluded) and the type of tires. If you have the tire types correct, but in a different order, the prediction is considered to be incorrect. A total of 25 point can be earned with predictions. 10 points for the correct race winner. 5 points for the correct amount of stops and 10 points for the correct tire types prediction. The stops and tire prediction are checked with the race winner.

## Drivers

You team consists of two drivers. Your drivers will gain points depending on how they perform in an actual Formula 1 race. Your driver can gain points with qualification results, races results, overtakes, and finishing the race. The table below shows the amount of points earned for drivers depending on their positions, for both the qualification and the race.

| Position | Qualification | Race |
| -------- | ------------- | ---- |
| 1        | 15            | 25   |
| 2        | 12            | 21   |
| 3        | 10            | 18   |
| 4        | 9             | 16   |
| 5        | 8             | 15   |
| 6        | 7             | 14   |
| 7        | 6             | 13   |
| 8        | 5             | 12   |
| 9        | 4             | 11   |
| 10       | 3             | 10   |
| 11       | 3             | 9    |
| 12       | 2             | 8    |
| 13       | 2             | 7    |
| 14       | 2             | 6    |
| 15       | 1             | 5    |
| 16       | 1             | 4    |
| 17       | 1             | 3    |
| 18       | 1             | 3    |
| 19       | 0             | 2    |
| 20       | 0             | 2    |

Finally, drivers can also earn overtake points. 2 points per position gained. This means that when a driver qualifies 11th, and finishes 5th, 6 positions are gained meaning 12 points. The overtake points also count when the driver lost positions during the race. So the overtake points can also turn out to be negative. Finally, when your driver finishes the race, you will receive a bonus of 10 points.

## Engines

Like drivers you gain points with qualification and race results for your engine. Keep in mind that although you own only one engine, there are actually two drivers with that engine in their car. This means the points calculations for an engine after the race, depends on the performance of two drivers. Unlike drivers, no points will be gained with overtake actions. Instead you will receive a 10 points bonus when your engine qualifies first and finishes first (this does not nessecarily have to be the same driver). And an additional 10 points when your engine drove the fastest lap.

| Position | Qualification | Race |
| -------- | ------------- | ---- |
| 1        | 10            | 20   |
| 2        | 7             | 16   |
| 3        | 5             | 14   |
| 4        | 4             | 13   |
| 5        | 4             | 12   |
| 6        | 3             | 11   |
| 7        | 3             | 10   |
| 8        | 3             | 9    |
| 9        | 2             | 8    |
| 10       | 2             | 7    |
| 11       | 2             | 6    |
| 12       | 2             | 5    |

| 19       | 0             | 3    |
| 20       | 0             | 2    |

## Chassis

Like drivers you gain points with qualification and race results for your chassis. Keep in mind that although you own only one chassis, there are actually two drivers with that chassis. This means the points calculations for a chassis after the race, depends on the performance of two drivers. Unlike drivers, no points will be gained with overtake actions. Instead you will receive a 10 points bonus when your chassis drove the fastest lap.
